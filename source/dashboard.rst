Dashboard
=========

The dashboard contains the most common tasks, recently opened repositories and categories (favourites).
Categories can be added, grouped in the repository context menu.

Recent Repositories can be moved to favourites using the repository context menu. Choose ``Categories / Add new`` to create a new category
and add the repository to it, or you can add the repository to an existing category (e.g. 'Currents' as shown below).

To open an existing repository, simply click the link to the repository, or
select Open repository (from where you can select a repository to open from your local file system).

To create a new repository, one of the following options under Common Actions can be selected.

Create new repository
---------------------

When you do not want to work on an existing project, you can create your own repository using this option.

Select a directory where the repository is to be created. You can choose to create a Personal repository or a Central repository.

A personal repository looks the same as a normal working directory but has a directory named ``.git`` at the root level
containing the version history. This is the most common repository.

Central repositories only contain the version history. Because a central repository has no working directory you cannot
checkout a revision in a central repository. It is also impossible to merge or pull changes in a central repository. This
repository type can be used as a public repository where developers can push changes to or pull changes from.

Open repository
----------------

Opens a Git repo already existing on the file system.

Clone repository
----------------

You can clone an existing repository using this option.

.. image:: /images/dashboard/clone.png

The repository you want to clone could be on a network share or could be a repository that is accessed through an internet
or intranet connection. Depending on the protocol (http or ssh) you might need to load a SSH key into PuTTY. You also need to specify where
the cloned repository will be created and the initial branch that is checked out. If the cloned repository contains submodules, then these
can be initialized using their default settings if required.

There are two different types of repositories you can create when making a clone. A personal repository contains the complete
history and also contains a working copy of the source tree. A central (bare) repository is used as a public repository where
developers push the changes they want to share with others to. A central repository contains the complete history but does not
have a working directory like personal repositories.

Clone Github repository
-----------------------
