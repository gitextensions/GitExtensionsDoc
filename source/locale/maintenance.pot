msgid "Git will create a lot of files. You can run the ``Compress git database`` to pack all small files building up a repository into one big file. Git will also garbage collect all unused objects that are older then 15 days. When a database is fragmented into a many small files compressing the database can increase performance."

You can add files that should be ignored to the .gitignore file. You can use wildcards and regular expressions. All entries are case sensitive. The button ``Add default ignores`` will add files that should be ignored when using Visual Studio."
