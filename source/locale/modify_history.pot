msgid "A Git commit cannot be changed, the sha for the commit will replaced at all changes. However, the contents of a commit can be modified and committed again as a new commit with a new sha and the branch/tag can be moved to the modified (new) commit."

#: ../modify_history.rst:10
msgid "A commit can be reverted, the changes of a certain commit can be reverted and added as a new commit. Similar, a commit can be applied again (possibly to a new branch), known as cherry picking."

msgid "The commit can be added again (and all commits that are children to the commit) as new commits and git branches can be made to point to the new commit instead."

msgid "Note: There are 2 things to understand when working with the history with git:"
msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:20
msgid "As git only creates immutable commits (sealed by the sha1), \"modifying\" a commit is in fact creating a new more or less similar commit."
msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:21
msgid "Consequently, the entire history of children following the changed commit will be different."
msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:23
msgid "So, except if the history has not been already pushed, or if you have good reasons, it is a bad practice to change the history because you will mess the history of other developers."

msgid "Cherry pick commit"
msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:29
msgid "A commit can be recommitted by using the cherry pick function. This can be very useful when you want to make the same change on multiple branches. Select the commit (or range of commits) you want to cheery pick:"

msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:41
msgid "A commit cannot be deleted once it is published. If you need to undo the changes made in a commit, you need to create a new commit that undoes the changes. This is called a revert commit. A revert commit is similar to a cherry pick, but the cherry pick tries to apply the same changes as the original commit, a revert will try to reverse the changes."

msgid "Modify the last commit"
msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:54
msgid "The easiest way to modify the last commit is to do an ``amend`` commit. To do that, open the commit windows and check the option \"Amend commit\". If the commit message text area was empty, it is now filled with the message of the last commit. You could now just update the commit message and commit or also add some more changes in the staging area to add them to the commit."

msgid "Modify an older commit"

#: ../modify_history.rst:65
msgid "It normally makes sense just to change the history for the current branch. To change the parents of the current branch you will have to make a ``rebase``. Git Extensions has functionality that wraps the Git rebase commands and simplifies usage in some situations."

msgid "Interactive rebase"
msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:70
msgid "First, you should create a commit containing the changes you want to add to a previous commit (or know an existing commit that contains this changes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../modify_history.rst:73
msgid "Then use the `rebase` feature in interactive mode on a base commit older than the one that you want to modify. See :ref:`branches` for how to start a rebase, start an interactive rebase from the context menu or by selecting the checkbox in the rebase dialog."

msgid "The interactive rebase will process the same way but with a major difference! When enabling the `Autosquash` option, git will automatically reorder the commits lines and write the good actions in front of the commits when it will open the text editor. You normally have just to close the editor (except if you want to do additional changes). And let git do the rebase."
