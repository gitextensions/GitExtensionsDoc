msgid "If there are local changes that you do not want to commit yet and not want to throw away either, you can temporarily stash them. This is useful when working on a feature and you need to start working on something else for a few hours. You can stash changes away and then reapply them to your working dir again later. Stashes are typically used for very short periods."
