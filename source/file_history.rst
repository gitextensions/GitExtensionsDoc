File history
============

``File history`` is a separate form to view the history of a file or folder.
Since Git Extensions 4.0 this functionality is included in :ref:`browse-repository`
but can be activated by :ref:`settings-general-show-file-history-in-the-main-window`.
This form is deprecated and may be removed in future releases.

To display the single file history, right click on a file name in
:ref:`browse-repository-tabs-file-tree` or :ref:`browse-repository-tabs-diff` tab
and select ``File history`` or ``Blame``.

The single file history viewer shows all revisions of a single file or submodules.
