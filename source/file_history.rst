File history
============

``File history`` is a separate form to view the history of a file or folder.
Since Git Extensions 4.0 this functionality is included in :ref:`browse-repository`,
see specifically :ref:`filter-file`.
This form is deprecated and may be removed in future releases.

To display the single file history, right click on a file name in the :ref:`browse-repository` ``File tree`` or in the ``Diff`` tab and select ``File history`` or ``Blame``.
The single file history viewer shows all revisions of a single file or submodules.
